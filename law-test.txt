CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE ANIL KUMAR SINHA
JUDGMENT AND ORDER
C.A.V.
Date : 19-09-2025
Since all these five writ petitions involve common
questions of law and fact, with the consent of the parties, they have
been heard together and are being decided by this common
judgment/order.
2. The petitioners, in all these writ applications, have a
common prayer for quashing the orders passed by the Vice
Chancellor of the Aryabhatta Knowledge University, Patna (herein
after referred to as ‘the University’), and communicated by the
Controller of Examination of the University, whereby the Vice
Chancellor of the University has decided to cancel the admission
of the petitioners in M.B.B.S. course and further directed their
permanent expulsion from the University.
3. The brief facts involved in CWJC No. 19657 of 2024
(Bhawesh Kumar Bhaskar v. The State of Bihar and Others),
is that the petitioner is a student of 3rd Professional M.B.B.S. Part–
II course, at Darbhanga Medical College, Darbhanga. The
allegation against the petitioner is that one Aunish Kumar, a
student of IGIMS, Patna, appeared in the 3rd Professional MBBS
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
5/51
Part–II, 2023 Examination on behalf of the petitioner in the
Pediatrics paper. The petitioner thereby committed impersonation.
4. On 04.10.2024, a show cause notice was issued by the
Controller of Examination alleging that another student had
appeared in the 3rd Professional MBBS Part–II Examination in
place of the petitioner. The petitioner submitted his reply denying
the allegation, asserting that he had not appeared in the
examination, in question, due to illness.
5. Subsequently, by letter no. 4766, dated 19.10.2024,
issued under the signature of the Controller of Examination of the
University, the petitioner was directed to appear on 23.10.2024
before the 57th meeting of the Unfair Means Committee. The
petitioner appeared on the said date and furnished his written
reply, reiterating his earlier stand that, he could not appear in the
examination due to illness and stating that the allegation levelled
against him was baseless.
6. Upon consideration of the report submitted by the
Central Superintendent of the University as well as reply of the
petitioner, the Committee held that the conduct of the petitioner
amounted to impersonation, which fell under Clause 5.2 (c) of the
Rules for Unfair Means, i.e., in respect of the student for whom the
impersonator was appearing.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
6/51
7. Accordingly, the Committee recommended for
cancellation of the admission of the petitioner in the M.B.B.S.
course and his expulsion from the University.
8. Pursuant to the said decision, the impugned order
,dated 12.11.2024, was issued under the signature of the Controller
of Examination of the University, whereby the decision to cancel
the admission of the petitioner in the M.B.B.S. course and his
expulsion from the University was conveyed to the Principal,
Darbhanga Medical College, Darbhanga.
9. The brief facts, giving rise to CWJC No. 267 of 2025
(Afzal Azad v. The State of Bihar and Others) is that the
petitioner has prayed for the quashing of the order, dated
13.11.2024, issued under the signature of the Principal, Sri
Krishna. Medical College, Muzaffarpur, whereby, the Principal,

the admission of the petitioner in the M.B.B.S. course to the
College and also directed for his expulsion from the College.

Part–I at Sri Krishna Medical College, Muzaffarpur. The allegation
against the petitioner is that the petitioner appeared in the 3rd
Professional MBBS Part–II, 2023 Examination on behalf of one
Brajesh Kumar in the E.N.T. paper, and committed impersonation.

the petitioner was directed to appear before a High-Level
Committee in connection with an inquiry in the alleged
impersonation committed by him in the 3rd Professional MBBS
Part–I and Part–II Examinations, 2023. The petitioner appeared
before the said High-Level Committee on 07.10.2024 and was
further directed to appear before the 57th Unfair Means Committee
on 23.10.2024.
12. The petitioner appeared before the Committee on
23.10.2024 and submitted his show cause reply. Upon
consideration of the report submitted by the Central
Superintendent of the University as well as the reply of the
petitioner, the Committee came to the conclusion that the
petitioner has committed impersonation, which fell under Clause
5.2 (a) of the Rules for Unfair Means, i.e., if the impersonator is
identified as a student of the University.
13. Accordingly, the Committee recommended for
cancellation of the admission of the petitioner in the M.B.B.S.

of the petitioner in the M.B.B.S. course and his expulsion from the
University.

Ranjan v. The State of Bihar and Others) is that the petitioner is
a student of 3rd Professional MBBS Part I, at Government Medical
College, Bettiah, West Champaran. The allegation against the
petitioner is that one Vishal Kumar, a student of the same College,
appeared in the 3rd Professional MBBS Part–I, 2023 Examination
in the E.N.T. paper, on behalf of the petitioner, thereby committing
impersonation.
15. On 04.10.2024, a show cause notice was issued by
the Controller of Examination of the University, alleging that

issued under the signature of the Controller of Examination of the
University, the petitioner was directed to appear before the 57th
Unfair Means Committee on 23.10.2024.
17. The petitioner appeared before the Committee on
23.10.2024 and submitted his show cause reply. After considering
the report submitted by the Central Superintendent of the
University as well as the reply of the petitioner, the Committee
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
9/51
came to the finding that the petitioner has committed
impersonation, which fell under Clause 5.2 (c) of the Rules for
Unfair Means, i.e., in respect of the student for whom the
impersonator was appearing.
18. Accordingly, the Committee recommended for
cancellation of the admission of the petitioner in the M.B.B.S.
course and his expulsion from the University.

petitioner is a student of 3rd Professional MBBS Part–II at
Government Medical College, Bettiah, West Champaran. The
allegation against the petitioner is that he, being a student of the
said College, appeared in the 3rd Professional MBBS Part–I, 2023
Examination in place of Arvind Kumar Mehta, thereby he has

10/51
Part–I and Part–II Examinations, 2023. The petitioner appeared

petitioner to appear before the 57th Unfair Means Committee on
23.10.2024.
22. The petitioner appeared before the Committee on
23.10.2024 and submitted his show cause reply. Upon

Superintendent of the University and the reply of the petitioner, the

Kumar v. The State of Bihar and Others) is that the petitioner
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025

internship after registering with the Bihar Council of Medical
Registration.
26. The allegation against the petitioner is that he, being
a student of Government Medical College, Bettiah, West
Champaran, appeared in the 3rd Professional MBBS Part–I, 2023
Examination on behalf of Ashish Ranjan in the E.N.T. paper,
thereby committing impersonation.
27. On 04.10.2024, a show cause notice was issued by
the Controller of Examination of the University regarding his
alleged impersonation and was called upon to submit his reply.
Subsequently, by letter no. 4846, dated 22.10.2024, issued under
the signature of the Controller of Examination of the University,
the petitioner was directed to appear before the 57th Unfair Means
Committee on 23.10.2024.
28. The petitioner appeared before the Committee on
t23.10.2024 and submitted his show cause reply. Upon
consideration of the report submitted by the Central
Superintendent of the University and the reply of the petitioner, the
Committee recorded that the case involved impersonation by the
petitioner. The Committee came to the conclusion that the
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
12/51
petitioner has committed impersonation and this conduct of the
petitioner fall under Clause 5.2 (a) of the Rules for Unfair Means,
i.e., if the impersonator is identified as a student of the University.
29. Accordingly, the Committee recommended for
cancellation of the admission of the petitioner in the M.B.B.S.
course and his expulsion from the University.
30. Pursuant to this recommendation of the Committee,
the impugned orders, dated 12.11.2024 and 20.11.2024, were
passed cancelling the admission of the petitioner in the M.B.B.S.
course and his expulsion from the University.
31. It is also relevant to mention here that in relation to
the aforesaid allegation, Jakkanpur Police Station Case No. 554 of
2024, dated 27.09.2024, was registered against all the petitioners
under Section 319 (2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 and in
the said case, all the petitioners are on bail.
32. Learned counsel for the petitioners has informed this
Court the current status of the petitioners. The petitioners, namely,
Bhawesh Kumar Bhaskar and Abhishek Kumar, have completed
the 3rd Professional Part–II i.e. Final Year MBBS Examination;
however, their results have been withheld, as a result of which they
are unable to join the internship programme.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
13/51
33. The petitioners, Afzal Azad and Ashish Ranjan, are
presently studying in the 3rd Professional Part–I i.e. 3rd Year of
M.B.B.S. course. Although the 3rd Professional Part–II course has
commenced, they have not been allowed to attend their classes.
34. The petitioner Vishal Kumar was an intern,
registered with the Bihar Council of Medical Registration at
Government Medical College & Hospital, Bettiah, West
Champaran, vide provisional registration certificate, dated
15.07.2024. He had already completed his MBBS course from the
said College in 2024. During the pendency of the present writ
application, he completed his internship on 15.07.2025, and has
been issued an Internship Certificate, bearing Memo No. 1554
dated 21.07.2025.
35. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners submits
that the imposition of punishment of cancellation of admission and
consequent expulsion from the university on the ground of
impersonation is wholly disproportionate and unreasonable. It has
been argued that such an extreme penalty would cause irreversible
and irreparable damage to the career as well as the overall well
being of the petitioners. By imposing such punishment, the
respondents have failed to take into account the cascading effect of
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
14/51
the decision on the life, dignity, and future prospects of the
petitioners.
36. Referring to the provisions of the Aryabhatta
Knowledge University Act, 2008 (herein after referred to as ‘the
Act’), it has been submitted that Section 27 of the Act deals with
the power to make statutes. Section 27 (16) of the Act provides
that statutes may be framed regarding the maintenance of
discipline amongst employees and students of the University,
colleges and institutions.
37. Similarly, Section 29 of the Act deals with the power
to make ordinances, and in particular Section 29 (1) (n) of the Act
stipulates that ordinances may provide for the categories of
misconduct for which action may be taken under the Act, the
statutes or the ordinances.
38. Further, Section 30 of the Act deals with the power
to make regulations, whereby the authorities of the University may
make regulations consistent with the Act, the statutes and the
ordinances. It is, thus, submitted that any provision in relation to
the maintenance of discipline or prescribing categories of
misconduct can be framed validly through a statute or an
ordinance in accordance with the Act.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
15/51
39. In the present case, the ‘Rules for Unfair Means’ do
not indicate under which provision of the Act, it has been framed
nor do it discloses its statutory backing.
40. Section 46 of the Act mandates that every statute,
ordinance or regulation made under the Act shall be published in
the Official Gazette. However, in the case of the ‘Rules for Unfair
Means’, there is no indication that they have been so published.
41. To the contrary, invoking the power under Section
27 of the Act, a statute has already been framed. Section 27 of the
Statute specifically deals with the maintenance of discipline
amongst the students and employees of the University and the
procedure thereunder. This statute has also been duly published in
the Official Gazette.
42. Learned Counsel for the petitioners, referring to
Section 27 of the Statute, further argued that Section 27 of the
Statute deals with the maintenance of discipline amongst the
students and employees of the University and Clause (a) of Section
27 provides that the Vice Chancellor of the University shall have
the authority and power to take action for maintaining discipline
and to impose disciplinary measures in relation to the students and
employees of the University, in accordance with the provisions
contained in the Statute.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
16/51
43. Further, Clause (d) of Section 27 prescribes that the
Vice Chancellor may, in exercise of such powers, by order, direct
that any student be expelled or rusticated for a specified period or
be not admitted to any course of study in a college, institution,
department, or school of the University for the stated period, or be
punished with a fine of a specified amount, or be debarred from
taking one or more examinations conducted by the University, or
that the results of the students in the examination in which he has
appeared be withheld or cancelled.
44. Relying upon Clause (d), learned Senior Counsel
submits that the Vice Chancellor has discretion to impose a range
of punishments in disciplinary matters, including expulsion,
rustication, fine, debarment from examinations and cancellation or
withholding of results. However, in the present case, the Vice
Chancellor chose to impose the extreme penalty of cancellation of
admission, coupled with permanent expulsion, which is grossly
disproportionate and unreasonable in the facts and circumstances
of the case.
45. It has been argued that Clause (f) of Section 27 of
the Statutes permits the University to frame rules of discipline, like
in the present case, ‘Rules for Unfair Means’, is without prejudice
to the powers of the Vice Chancellor under Clause (d). Therefore,
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
17/51
the Rules for Unfair Means should be read harmoniously with
Section 27 (d), and not as removing or curtailing the discretion
expressly vested with the Vice Chancellor. Even when acting
under the Rules for Unfair Means, the Vice Chancellor is required
to consider the facts of each case and choose a punishment
proportional to the gravity of the alleged misconduct.
46. It is further argued that Clause (f) of Section 27 is
supplemental to Clause (d). The Rules for Unfair Means, under
which the impugned punishments have been imposed, contravene
Section 27(d) and curtails the discretion otherwise vested with the
Vice Chancellor under the Act inasmuch as those Rules do not
provide any scope for the exercise of such discretion.
47. In the present matter, however, the Vice Chancellor
has imposed the most extreme penalty, i.e. cancellation of
admission and permanent expulsion from the University without
recording any reasons as to why lesser punishments, expressly
contemplated under Section 27(d), were not considered
appropriate and renders the decision disproportionate and
unreasonable, especially given the severe and irreversible impact
on the petitioners’ careers and future prospects.
48. Moreover, learned Senior Counsel argued that there
is no statutory backing for the Rules for Unfair Means as it does
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
18/51
not indicate the provision of the Act under which it has been
framed nor does it bear the signature of the competent rule-making
authority. Furthermore, such rules cannot override or be in
supersession of the statute itself, particularly when they take away
the discretion vested with the Vice Chancellor under Section 27(d)
of the statute.
49. Accordingly, it is submitted that the punishment
imposed upon the petitioners, besides lacking a valid legal
foundation, is unduly harsh and liable to be set aside.
50. Relying upon the rules of other universities, learned
Senior Counsel submits that the imposition of punishment of
cancellation of admission is disproportionately harsh in the present
case, which is evident from the comparatively lesser punishments
prescribed by other institutions.
51. Reference, in this regard, is made to Clause E,
Punishment II of the University of Delhi Rules on Procedure and
Punishment of Unfair means/Disorderly Conduct in Examination,
which provides that in such cases, the punishment shall be
cancellation of all the papers taken by the candidate in the current
semester/professional examination and further debarment from
appearing in any examination of the University till the end of the
next five subsequent semester/professional examinations. It further
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
19/51
permits the candidate to reappear in the same semester/
professional examination conducted by the University during the
subsequent third academic session at the earliest.
52. Attention has also been invited to Rule 12 of Use of
Unfair Means in Examinations and Penalties of AIIMS, Rajkot,
which prescribes punishment in the form of awarding zero marks
in the concerned examination and debarment of the student from
appearing in the respective professional examination for a
maximum period of three years, or as otherwise determined by the
Committee.
53. Further, reference is made to the relevant rules of the
West Bengal University of Health Sciences, wherein the prescribed
punishment in cases of impersonation is cancellation of the
examination of the candidate.
54. It is submitted that when compared to these
standards adopted by other reputed medical and academic
institutions, the punishment of cancellation of admission, coupled
with expulsion from the University, as imposed upon the
petitioners in the present case, is manifestly excessive and
disproportionate.
55. Placing reliance on Para 5 of the Guidelines for
Promotion of Physical Fitness, Sports, Students' Health, Welfare,
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
20/51
Psychological and Emotional Well Being at Higher Educational
Institutions of India of the UGC, learned Senior Counsel submits
that the University ought to have adopted a reformist approach in
the present case. It has been argued that the Guidelines specifically
discourage purely punitive measures, like suspension or expulsion
without objective analysis of the alleged misconduct, and instead,
emphasize affirmative action through structured reform and self-
development programmes, psychological counselling, and
wellness initiatives such as yoga and meditation.
56. Accordingly, the submission is that the University
should have provided the petitioners an opportunity to reform;
rather than imposing the extreme penalty of cancellation of
admission and expulsion, which is disproportionate and has long
term adverse consequences on their career and well-being.
57. With respect to the petitioner Vishal Kumar (CWJC
no. 1012 of 2025), learned Senior Counsel submits that the
conduct rule being relied upon by the respondents is the Rules for
Unfair Means. Under Rule 5.1 (a) of the Rules, in a case of
impersonation, if the impersonator is identified to be a student of
the University, the prescribed punishment is that his/her admission
be cancelled and he/she will be expelled from the University.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
21/51
He/She will also be handed over to the police/Magistrate for action
under law.
58. It is submitted that reliance on this provision by the
respondents is wholly misplaced inasmuch as the petitioner is not a
student but an intern at the College, having already completed his
MBBS course in the year 2024. Since he has already graduated,
there is no occasion to cancel his admission. Therefore, the
decision to cancel the admission of the petitioner, who was no
longer a student of the University, is without jurisdiction. At best,
only Rule 5.1(b) of the Rules could have been invoked, which
stipulates that if the impersonator is identified to be other than a
student of the University, he/she will be handed over to the
police/Magistrate for action under law. Hence, the punishment of
cancellation of admission imposed upon the petitioner is, in no
case, permissible.
59. It is further submitted that a perusal of Clauses 5.1
(a) and (c) of the Rules would indicate that both provisions are
applicable only in respect of students. The respondents have
erroneously proceeded on the premise that the petitioner continues
to be a student of the University as the MBBS course is said to be
completed only after the one-year compulsory internship is
completed. The real issue, however, is whether Vishal Kumar
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
22/51
remains a student of the University, so as to attract disciplinary
jurisdiction under the Rules for Unfair Means.
60. In this context, reliance is placed on the National
Medical Commission (Compulsory Rotating Medical Internship)
Regulations, 2021, wherein Rule 2 (e) defines an “Intern” as a
medical graduate undergoing compulsory rotating internship
training under these regulations. Therefore, even though the
MBBS degree may not yet have been formally conferred, an intern
cannot be equated with a student of the University for the purposes
of disciplinary action under the Rules. Accordingly, the impugned
order cancelling the admission of the petitioner and consequent
expulsion is beyond jurisdiction and is unsustainable.
61. Lastly, learned Senior Counsel submits that the
action of the respondent University in cancelling the admission of
the petitioners and ordering their consequent expulsion from the
University is violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of
India.
62. Learned Counsel placed heavy reliance upon the
decision of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, in the
case of X v. Maharashtra National Law University, through its
Vice Chancellor and Others, reported in 2024 SCCOnline Bom
3258, particularly paragraph 17, wherein the Court, while
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
23/51
examining the aspect of proportionality vis-à-vis punishment,
reiterated that in judicial review under Article 226, the Writ Court
is principally concerned with the decision-making process rather
than the decision itself. If the process is fair and the decision is
otherwise in accordance with law, interference would not be
warranted. However, the Court also emphasized that the choice
and quantum of punishment, though within the discretion of the
competent authority, can be interfered with if it is found to be so
disproportionate to the act in question as to shock one’s judicial
conscience, applying the principle laid down by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of Ranjit Thakur v. Union of India,
reported in 1987 INSC 285.
63. Further reliance is placed on paragraph 20 of
Maharashtra National Law University (supra), wherein the
Division Bench referred to the Allahabad High Court’s decision, in
the case of Anant Narayan Mishra v. Union of India, reported in
2019 AHC 201145, observing that termination of dialogue with a
delinquent student without offering any opportunity to reform
makes him an outcast, resulting in a total loss of human self-worth,
and that suspension or debarment amounts to the University
abandoning its ward.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
24/51
64. Referring to paragraph 21 of Maharashtra National
Law University (supra), wherein the Division Bench discussed
the decision of the Karnataka High Court, in the case of T.T.
Chakravarthy Yuvaraj v. Principal, B.M.S. College of
Engineering and Others, reported in 1996 SCC ONLINE Kar
616, wherein the challenge to an order of expulsion was
considered and it was held that to permanently end the career of
the students would not be an appropriate punishment and instead,
expulsion for a period of three years was deemed sufficient.
65. Finally, reliance is placed on paragraph 32 of
Maharashtra National Law University (supra),, wherein,
applying the principle of proportionality, it was directed that the
order of expulsion in that case should operate only till the end of
the academic year 2024–2025.
66. It has been submitted that the ratio of the decision, in
Maharashtra National Law University (supra), squarely applies
to the present case and the punishment of permanent cancellation
of admission and expulsion from the University is grossly
disproportionate, especially when a lesser punishment could serve
the ends of justice while preserving the possibility of reformation.
67. Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners further
submits that the respondents have failed to appreciate that the
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
25/51
present case is fit to be allowed in equity in terms of the law laid
down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Ramesh Chandra Sankla
and Others v. Vikram Cement and Others, reported in (2008)
14 SCC 58, wherein it was affirmed that the jurisdiction of the
High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution is
discretionary and equitable. In the facts of the present case,
upholding the punishment of cancellation of admission would
sound the death knell for the petitioners, leaving them with no
opportunity for redemption or rehabilitation.
68. On the other hand, learned Counsel for the
University submits that the present writ applications have been
contested primarily on five grounds, as urged by the petitioners,
namely-
(i) the impugned action cancelling the admission of the
petitioners and ordering their subsequent expulsion from the
University is violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of
India;
(ii) the punishment imposed is incorrect and without
sufficient evidence;
(iii) the penalty of cancellation of admission is
disproportionate and unreasonable;
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
26/51
(iv) the punishment is against human life and dignity
and not based on equity; and
(v) although in the original writ petitions or in the
interlocutory applications there is no specific pleading challenging
the validity of the Rules for Unfair Means of the University, during
the course of arguments verbal submissions have been advanced
seeking to question the vires of the said Rules.
69. Replying to the first and fourth grounds, learned
Counsel for the University submits that all the petitioners have
accepted their guilt of having indulged in the act of impersonation
during the examination. The question, which now arises, is
whether a person who has committed an offence can claim
infringement of fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 21 of the
Constitution.
70. In the present case, every offender has been treated
equally and the punishment prescribed under the Rules for Unfair
Means of the University has been imposed without any
discrimination. Therefore, there is no question of violation of
Article 14 of the Constitution.
71. As regards Article 21 of the Constitution, it has been
submitted that the said Article guarantees the right to life and
personal liberty, but that right is not absolute. Article 21 of the
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
27/51
Constitution itself stipulates that no person shall be deprived of his
life or personal liberty except according to procedure established
by law.
72. In the present case, the punishment for
impersonation has been imposed strictly in accordance with the
procedure established by law after affording proper opportunity of
hearing to all the petitioners. Countering the petitioners’ argument
that the High Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction, would act not
only as a court of law but also as a court of equity, learned Counsel
submits that one who seeks equity must do equity. Equity
promotes honesty and fair play and the petitioners, by indulging in
impersonation, have acted in the manner, which is entirely
contrary to these principles. Their conduct is not at all equitable
and, therefore, no equitable relief ought to be granted to them.
73. Replying to the second and fifth grounds contested
by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners, learned Counsel for
the University, referring to various provisions of the Aryabhatta
Knowledge University Act, 2008, and the Statute framed
thereunder, submits that the Rules for Unfair Means have been
duly formulated with the approval of the Vice Chancellor. The said
Rules derive their authority from the provisions of the Act and the
Statute, particularly Section 27 (f) of the Statute.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
28/51
74. It has further been submitted that the University has
conducted the proceedings against the petitioners strictly in
accordance with these Rules, and all procedural requirements,
including compliance with the principles of natural justice, have
been met. The petitioners were issued show cause notices and
given opportunity to submit their written replies. Thereafter, they
were directed to appear before the 57th meeting of the Unfair
Means Committee, and proper opportunity of hearing was afforded
to them. It is further contended that all the petitioners admitted
their involvement in the alleged impersonation during the
examination and they have been penalized strictly in accordance
with the Rules for Unfair Means, particularly Clause 5.1 thereof.
75. With regard to the challenge made during the course
of arguments to the validity of the Rules for Unfair Means, it is
submitted that such challenge is not maintainable inasmuch as
neither the original writ petitions nor any supplementary affidavit
contains any such plea. A constitutional challenge to the vires of
the Rules cannot be entertained in the absence of proper pleadings.
76. Referring to the Rules for Unfair Means, learned
Counsel submits that the said Rules are in consonance with the
object and purpose of the Act and have a reasonable and rational
nexus with the aims they seek to achieve.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
29/51
77. It has been argued that the Rules have been framed
to uphold the integrity of the examination process and to deter
serious misconduct, such as impersonation. The punishment
imposed upon the petitioners has been expressly provided in these
Rules. The impugned action has not been taken by the Vice
Chancellor on his whims or fancies, but strictly in accordance with
the provisions of the Rules after following the due process.
78. Relying on Section 27 (g) of the Statute, learned
Counsel points out that at the time of admission, every student is
required to sign a declaration submitting himself to the
disciplinary jurisdiction of the Vice Chancellor and other
authorities of the University. The petitioners, having voluntarily
accepted this jurisdiction at the time of their admission, are bound
by the disciplinary framework, including the penalties prescribed
for misconduct under the Rules for Unfair Means.
79. With regard to the petitioner, Vishal Kumar, learned
Counsel for the University submits that the contention of the
petitioner that he has already passed the MBBS examination from
the College and is now an intern, registered with the Bihar Council
of Medical Registration, and, therefore, he cannot be treated as a
student of the University and does not fall within the purview of
the Rules, is wholly misconceived. The petitioner continues to be
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
30/51
a student of the University as his internship is still ongoing. As per
the guidelines of the Medical Council of India, only after
successful completion of the mandatory internship is the degree of
MBBS formally conferred upon a student. It is only upon the grant
of such degree that a candidate ceases to be a student of the
University and till then, the student remains under the disciplinary
jurisdiction of the University and is governed by the provisions of
the Aryabhatta Knowledge University Act, the Statute, and tthe
Rules for Unfair Means. He further submits that on 27.09.2024,
while the ENT paper for the 3rd Professional MBBS Part–I
Examination was in progress, and during verification of the admit
cards of the examinees, it was found by the Invigilator that the
petitioner, being a student of the University who had passed the
MBBS course but was still an intern, had adopted the method of
impersonation by appearing and writing the examination in place
of petitioner Ashish Ranjan, a student of Government Medical
College, Bettiah under the University.
80. The Invigilator prepared and submitted his report,
dated 27.09.2024, to the University, informing that the petitioner
had been caught appearing and writing in place of the said
examinee. This report bears the signature of the petitioner. The
Centre Superintendent of the examination thereafter verified the
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
31/51
incident and prepared his own report confirming the
impersonation.
81. Learned counsel for the University submits that the
petitioners have thus rightly been imposed with the punishment
prescribed under the Rules for Unfair Means and there is no
question of the penalty being disproportionate. It is emphasized
that the petitioners committed the offence of impersonation in a
medical course examination such as MBBS, which is directly
connected to public health and safety. Such misconduct is an
offence against society at large and especially in light of the
petitioners’ admission of guilt, they deserve no sympathy from this
Court.
82. Learned counsel for the respondent University, has
placed reliance on the following judgments of the Hon’ble
Supreme Court :-
1. Board of High School and Intermediate Education,
U. P. v. Bagleshwar Prasad and Others (AIR 1996 SC 875);
2. Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and
Higher Secondary Education and Others v. Paritosh
Bhupeshkumar Sheth and Others, reported in (1984) 4 SCC 27;

Higher Secondary Education and Others v. K.S. Gandhi and
Others, reported in (1991) 2 SCC 716;

7. Ram Preeti Yadav v. U.P. Board of High School

SCC 311; and
8. Director (Studies) and Others v. Vaibhav Singh
Chauhan, reported in 2009 (1) PLJR 108 SC.
83. I have heard learned Counsel for the parties
concerned and have gone through the entire materials available on
record.
84. The petitioners before this Court are young students,
pursuing the professional medical course, having secured
admission on merit and successfully completed a substantial part
of the course. The allegations of impersonation has been levelled
against them while taking examination, whereupon proceedings
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
33/51
were initiated under the Rules of Unfair Means. The petitioners
have been awarded the penalty of cancellation of admission and
permanent expulsion from the University.
85. According to the petitioners, the punishment is
unduly harsh and disproportionate to the nature of the misconduct.
The punishment order fails to take into account that they are the
first-time offenders without any adverse record in their academic
career. It has been further argued that the University authorities
have not exercised the discretion available under the parent Statute
and ignored the mandate of the UGC Guidelines, dated
12.04.2023, which emphasize corrective and reformative
measures.
86. On the other hand, learned Counsel for the
respondents has defended the action of the University, contending
that the penalty was imposed strictly in terms of the rules framed
under Section 27 (f) of the Statute. It has been submitted that
maintenance of academic discipline is of paramount importance in
institutions of higher learning, and the misconduct of the
petitioners, in the context in which it occurred, was of such a
nature that it warranted strict action so as to preserve the sanctity
of examination and institute and deter similar incidents in future. It
is argued that the University acted within its jurisdiction following
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
34/51
the prescribed procedure, and this Court, in exercise of writ
jurisdiction, ought not to substitute its views on the appropriate
penalty unless it is shown to be shockingly or disproportionate.
87. It is in this backdrop of rival submissions and
keeping in view both, the factual matrix and the legal framework,
this Court proceeds to examine the questions arising for
determination.
88. This Court is conscious of the fact that in the present
case, it is neither called upon to examine nor is it expressing any
opinion on the vires of the Rules for Unfair Means. The Court is
confining itself strictly to the issue at hand, namely, whether, in the
facts of the present case, the Vice Chancellor of the University,
while acting under Section 27 of the Statute read with the Rules,
has exercised the discretion vested with him and whether the
penalty imposed is proportionate to the proven misconduct, i.e.
impersonation. The adjudication herein is thus limited to the scope
of judicial review over the impugned orders in light of the
statutory framework and the settled principles of proportionality.
89. The Court is also cognizant of the settled position
that when it comes to the maintenance of academic standards,
judicial interference in the internal administration of educational
institutions should be exercised with great circumspection. The
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
35/51
decisions of academic bodies are largely in the nature of policy
decisions and are based upon their day-to-day experience in
maintaining discipline and academic integrity. So long as such
decisions are not arbitrary, unreasonable or violative of the
principles of natural justice, the Court ought not to interfere
therein. Every institution has the right to set its own benchmark for
achieving discipline in academic matters and is empowered to take
appropriate disciplinary action against delinquent students.
90. It is trite law that a rule cannot override the Act or
the Statute nor can it restrict the ambit of the parent legislation. In
the context of the present case, this principle means that the Rules
for Unfair Means, being subordinate legislation framed in exercise
of the enabling power conferred by the Statute, cannot operate to
curtail or take away the discretion expressly vested with the Vice
Chancellor of the University under Section 27(d) of the Statute to
impose one or more punishment enumerated therein. The
subordinate legislation is intended to be in aid of, and not in
derogation of, the parent Statute. It is well settled that such rules
must be read harmoniously with the provisions of the parent
Statute and cannot be so interpreted as to render the substantive
statutory provision otiose or nugatory. Therefore, even though the
Rules framed under Section 27(f) prescribe a specific punishment
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
36/51
of cancellation of admission and consequent expulsion for the
offence of impersonation, such prescription cannot be construed as
fettering the statutory discretion of the Vice Chancellor of the
University to consider and impose any of the punishment provided
under Section 27(d) of the Statute, as the facts and circumstances
of the case may warrant.
91. In the present case, the statutory framework under
Section 27(d) of the Statute vests the Vice Chancellor of the
University with a range of discretionary options in awarding
punishment. Section 27(f), while empowering the framing of
elaborate rules of discipline, expressly states that such rules are to
operate ‘without prejudice to the powers of the Vice Chancellor’.
This legislative phrase indicates that such rules supplement, rather
than supplant, the discretion conferred by Section 27(d). The Vice
Chancellor, therefore, remains under duty to apply his independent
mind to the facts of each case and select a punishment
commensurate with the gravity of the misconduct, guided by but
not bound in absolute terms with the subordinate legislation.
92. This Court finds guidance from the decision of the
Supreme Court, in the case of Dharani Sugars and Chemicals
Ltd. v. Union of India, reported in (2019) 5 SCC 480, wherein
the Supreme Court, while interpreting similar ‘without prejudice’
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
37/51
clause, held that such expressions indicate that the powers
conferred are additional to, and not in derogation of, other powers
contained in the same enactment. Furthermore, As held by the
Supreme Court, in the case of BSNL v. TRAI, reported in (2014)
3 SCC 222, and reaffirmed in Union of India v. Pfizer Ltd.,
reported in (2018) 2 SCC 39, the words ‘without prejudice’ make
it clear that the enumerated powers are only illustrative of the
general power and do not restrict or curtail it.
93. Applying this principle in the case at hand, Section
27 (f) of the Statute, under which the Rules for Unfair Means are
framed, expressly states that it is without prejudice to the powers
of the Vice Chancellor. This means that the discretion of the Vice
Chancellor, under Section 27(d), to impose a range of punishments
for misconduct, remains intact and cannot be curtailed by the
subordinate legislation framed under Section 27(f). The Rules for
Unfair Means must, therefore, be read as supplementary to the
statutory discretion of the Vice Chancellor. Any interpretation to
the contrary would amount to allowing subordinate legislation to
override the parent statute, which is impermissible in law.
94. From the plain reading of the impugned orders, it is
manifest that the Vice Chancellor mechanically accepted the
recommendation of the Unfair Means Committee without
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
38/51
recording any reason to demonstrate an independent exercise of
discretion. The penalty imposed in the present case, i.e.,
cancellation of admission and permanent expulsion is the
maximum available punishment under the rules and no
consideration is evident as to whether a lesser, but still deterrent,
penalty would meet the ends of justice, especially in the case of
students and first-time offenders. This absence of application of
mind is in itself a ground for judicial interference, independent of
the question of proportionality.
95. Now, come to the question of doctrine of
proportionality and the necessity of a reformist approach.
96. Having examined the statutory framework of the
University, this Court has found that the relevant statute vests
discretion with the Vice Chancellor to decide the appropriate
course of action in disciplinary matters. Such discretion, however,
must be exercised in consonance with constitutional mandates and
cannot be fettered or nullified by subordinate rules or executive
instructions, which cannot override the statute itself.
97. In the present case, the Vice Chancellor failed to
exercise such discretion judiciously and mechanically applied the
punitive provisions without considering the reformist possibilities.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
39/51
98. At this stage, it becomes necessary to address the
doctrine of proportionality, which has now become an integral part
of our constitutional jurisprudence.
99. The doctrine of proportionality has been discussed
by the Honb’le Supreme Court, in the case of Ranjit Thakur v.
Union of India, reported in (1987) 4 SCC 611, wherein the
Supreme Court, in paragraph 26, has held that the question of
choice and quantum of punishment, though within the jurisdiction
and discretion of the punishing authority, but the sentence has to
suit the offence and the offender; it should not be vindictive or
unduly harsh nor it should be so disproportionate to the offence so
as to shock the conscience and amount in itself to conclusive
evidence of bias; the punishment if in outrageous defiance of
logic, then would not be immune from correction.
100. The Supreme Court, in paragraph 26 of Ranjit
Thakur (supra), has also discussed the decision, in the case of
Bhagat Ram v. State of Himachal Pradesh reported in (1983) 2
SCC 442, wherein it was held that it is equally true that the
penalty imposed must be commensurate with the gravity of the
misconduct and that any penalty disproportionate to the gravity of
the misconduct would be violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
40/51
101. The Karnataka High Court, in paragraph 17 of T.
T. Chakravarthy Yuvaraj (supra), has observed that in inflicting
appropriate punishment, certain aspects have to be borne in mind.
When the relationship of the Head of the Institution and the
student is that of a parent and child, the punishment imposed
should not result in any retribution or give vent to a feeling of
wrath. The main purpose of punishment is to correct the fault of
the student concerned by making him more alert in future and to
hold out a warning to other students to be careful, so that they may
not expose themselves to similar punishment and the approach is
that of a parent towards an erring or misguided child. In order not
to attract the criticism that the action is a result of arbitrariness, it
has to be ensured that the penalty imposed is commensurate with
the magnitude of the fault. Certainly one cannot rationally or justly
impose the same penalty for giving a slap to the one imposed for
homicide. Unless the disciplinary authority reaches the conclusion
that having regard to the nature of the misconduct it would be
totally unsafe to retain them in the college, the maximum penalty
of expulsion from the college should not be imposed. If a lesser
penalty can be imposed without jeopardizing the interest of the
college, the disciplinary authority cannot impose a maximum
penalty of expulsion from the college. The concerned Head of the
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
41/51
Institution must necessarily have an introspection and a rational
faculty as to why lesser penalty cannot be imposed. In doing so, it
should also be borne in mind that when the maximum penalty is
imposed total ruination stares one in the eye rendering such
student a vagabond as being unwanted both by the parents and the
educational institution. Frustration that would result would
seriously jeopardize young life. Every harsh order results in
bitterness and arises a feeling of antagonism and many a time turn
a student into an anti-social element and in that way it results in
more harm than good to the Society.
102. Furthermore, the Delhi High Court, in the case of
Akshay Chaudhary v. University of Delhi, reported in 2010 SCC
OnLine Del 3061, while dealing with the case of permanent
expulsion held as follows:
“22.Therefore permanently putting an end to
the career of the petitioners would not be an appropriate
punishment. The Karnataka High Court quotes
Shakespeare in “Merchant of Venice”: “Justice should
be tempered with mercy” and Jesus Christ: “They know
not what they do. Forgive them”.
23. In the words of George Bernard Shaw, “If
you are to punish a man retributively, you must injure
him. If you are to reform him, you must improve him
and men, are not improved by injuries.” Modern
penologists hold the view that punishment should not
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
42/51
necessarily be ‘retributory’ and ‘deterrent’ but should
be ‘rehabilitative’. Hegel, a German Philosopher in his
theory on Punishment asserts that “object of
punishment is to make the criminal repent his crime,
and by doing so to realize his moral character, which
has been temporarily obscured by his wrong action, but
which is his deepest and truest nature.” Justice Krishna
Iyer in Mohammad Giasuddin v. State of Andhra
Pradesh, (1977) 3 SCC 287 emphasized, “The sub-
culture that leads to anti-social behaviour has to be
countered not by undue cruelty but by reculturisation.”
24. The Supreme Court in Divisional
Controller, N.E.K.R.T.C. v. H. Amaresh, (2006) 6 SCC
187 : AIR 2006 SC 2730 and UPSRTC v. Vinod Kumar,
(2008) 1 SCC 115 has held that the punishment should
always be proportionate to the gravity of the
misconduct and the High Court under Article 226 gets
jurisdiction to interfere with the punishment only when
it finds that the punishment imposed is shockingly
disproportionate to the charges prove.”
103. The Allahabad High Court, in the case of
Mohammad Zoraiz v. Aligarh Muslim University, reported in
2023 SCC OnLine All 4215, undertook an elaborate examination of
the principles governing academic discipline, the limits of punitive
action, and the necessity of adopting a reformist approach, while also
comprehensively considering the UGC Guidelines, dated
12.04.2023. The Court acknowledged that disciplinary action
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
43/51
becomes necessary in many cases of student misconduct. However,
equal emphasis was given to the reformist approach to deal with
aberrational behaviour by students. The Court further observed, on
perusal of the statutes of the universities, namely BHU, IIT-BHU and
AMU, that it is evident that they do not contain provisions for reform
and rehabilitation of delinquent students. The action against such
students is governed solely by the penal provisions of the statutes,
which adopt a punitive scheme to the exclusion of other methods.
The statutory frameworks of the universities examined in this case
reveal that all adopt a purely penal approach to deviant behaviour,
allowing for punishments such as suspension, expulsion, or
debarment, but containing no structured programmes for reform,
self-development, or rehabilitation. This statutory monopoly of a
punitive approach constrains the decision-maker, leading to
disproportionate punishments not because the authority lacks
capacity for a measured response, but because the ordinances
themselves preclude proportional alternatives. While the presence of
punitive provisions is necessary, the complete omission of
reformative measures results in an imbalance that adversely impacts
the rights of the students.
104. In the above background of the principles of
proportionality, the reformist approach, as well as the UGC
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
44/51
Guidelines, dated 10.04.2023, this Court has perused the Rules for
Unfair Means framed by the University under Section 27(f) of the
Statute. A plain reading of the said Rules reveals that while several
categories of unfair practices, such as possession of unauthorized
papers (Categories 1 and 2) or substitution of answer scripts
(Category 4), attract punishments limited to cancellation of the
current examination and/or debarment for a fix period. To the
contrary, the offence of impersonation (Category 5.1) carries only
a single and extreme punishment, i.e. cancellation of admission,
permanent expulsion from the University and handing over the
delinquent to the police or magistrate for criminal action.
105. It further bears emphasis that for all other
prescribed offences under the Rules, the punishments are fix in
nature and none contemplate permanent expulsion. The absence of
a graduated response in the case of impersonation stands out in
stark contrast.
106. This Court is well aware of the limits of judicial
review in matters pertaining to academic discipline; however, in
the present case, what weighs heavily on the conscience of the
Court is that the doctrine of proportionality demands a calibrated
and balanced response to the nature of the misconduct. The
punishment of permanent expulsion imposed on the petitioners,
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
45/51
coupled with the cancellation of their admission, is an action of
extreme severity. Such a measure carries irreversible and enduring
penal consequences, forecloses all avenues of reform and
extinguishes the academic future of young students at a single
stroke.
107. Moreover, the penalty imposed bears no rational or
reasonable nexus with the legitimate purpose it seeks to achieve
inasmuch as the objective of maintaining discipline in the
University cannot be pursued to the total exclusion of the equally
important goal of affording students an opportunity to reform and
rehabilitate.
108. In fact, as the UGC Guidelines of 12.04.2023
underscore that discipline in higher education institutions must be
pursued through a composite approach which supplements
deterrence with constructive reform and self-development
programmes. By imposing the most extreme punishment without
examining mitigating factors or the possibility of rehabilitation,
the University has not achieved a balance between the imperatives
of institutional discipline and the constitutional value of individual
reform.
in the case of 109. The analogy is apt that just as the Supreme Court,
Kulja Industries Ltd. v. Chief General Manager,
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
46/51
W.T. Project, BSNL (AIR 2014 SC 9), has held that blacklisting
an entity indefinitely is disproportionate and tantamount to
inflicting “economic death,” the permanent expulsion of a student
likewise amounts to “academic and professional death”. Such a
penalty, is unduly harsh and shockingly disproportionate to the
alleged misconduct. The absence of proportionality, the failure to
exercise discretion, and the adoption of a purely punitive approach
to the exclusion of reformist considerations are the reasons
because of which this court deems it appropriate to exercise its
power of judicial review in matters of academic discipline which
in normal circumstances this court should not have interfered
with.. The Court, therefore, is of the view that the punishment
imposed cannot be sustained in its present form.
110. I have also carefully considered the judgments
relied upon by the Learned Counsel for the University, but none of
the cases cited on behalf of the University pertains to the
imposition of the extreme penalty of permanent expulsion of a
student. In the humble view of this Court, such a punishment of
permanent expulsion is nothing short of a “death knell” to the
academic career of a young student, amounting to placing a full
stop on his future prospects and aspirations. Unlike the factual
matrix of the cases cited by the Learned Counsel for the
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
47/51
University, the present matter deals with the most severe penalty,
i.e., permanent expulsion.
111. Having concluded that the punishment imposed
upon the petitioner is unduly harsh and disproportionate to the
nature of the alleged misconduct, this Court also finds that the
Vice Chancellor, despite being vested with the statutory discretion
to impose range of punishments, has failed to exercise such
discretion in a judicious and balanced manner which would be
evident from the impugned orders. The approach adopted has been
purely punitive, to the exclusion of any reformative consideration,
thereby overlooking the petitioner’s potential to reform.
112. In such a situation, the next question is whether the
matter should be remitted to the University authorities for
reconsideration, or whether this Court, keeping in view the peculiar
facts of the case and the career of the students, in exercise of its
powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, ought itself to
modify the penalty so as to ensure that justice is done, consistent
with the doctrine of proportionality and the constitutional mandate to
adopt a reformist approach.
113. This Court has already come to the conclusion that
the punishment imposed cannot sustained in its present form. Since
the penalty imposed upon the petitioners are unduly harsh and
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
48/51
shockingly disproportionate, the question would, now, be whether
this Court should remit the matter back to the respondent University
for modification of penalty in terms of Section 27 (d) of the Statute
or this Court should itself modify the penalty imposed upon the
petitioners.
114. In my considered view, the petitioners are pursuing
professional medical course and interest of justice demands that
instead of remanding the matter back to the University for
reconsideration of the quantum of penalty, as per Section 27 (d),
this Court is inclined to modify the penalty for the reasons
discussed herein above.
115. This Court finds it appropriate to modify the
punishment imposed upon the petitioners in the following
manner :-
116. The petitioners, Bhawesh Kumar Bhaskar and
Abhishek Kumar, who, as informed by learned Senior Counsel for
the petitioners, was the student of 3rd Professional Part-II
Examination, i.e. Final Year of MBBS Examination, and were
found guilty of indulging in the misconduct of impersonation
during the last year of their respective course itself. Consequently,
their results of the said final year examination shall remain
withheld and shall not be published/declared.
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
49/51
117. Further, in modification of the penalty of
cancellation of admission and permanent expulsion from the
University, it is directed that the aforesaid two petitioners shall
remain expelled from the University for a period of three years
reckoned from the date of the order of the Vice Chancellor.
118. With respect to the petitioners, Afzal Azad and
Ashish Ranjan, as informed by learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioners, they are presently pursuing the 3rd Professional Part-I
Examination (3rd Year). Insofar as these two petitioners are
concerned, it is directed that the result of the examination in which
they were found guilty of misconduct shall remain withheld and
the same shall not be published/declared.
119. In modification of the punishment as originally
imposed upon them, it is further directed that these petitioners
shall remain expelled from the College/University for a period of
three years reckoned from the date of the order of the Vice
Chancellor.
120. Insofar as the petitioner, Vishal Kumar, is
concerned, as informed by learned Senior Counsel for the
petitioners, he has already completed his MBBS course in the year
2024 and during the pendency of the present writ petitions, he has
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
50/51
also undergone and completed his one-year compulsory rotatory
internship on 15.07.2025.
121. Taking into account the peculiar facts of the case
of the petitioner, Vishal Kumar, and the stage of his academic
career, this Court finds it appropriate that MBBS degree of the
petitioner shall not be conferred for a further period of two
years, reckoning from the date of the order passed by the Vice
Chancellor. In addition, the petitioner, Vishal Kumar, shall be
liable to pay a fine of Rs. 5,00,000/- (five lakhs) to the University,
which shall be deposited by him before the expiry of two years.
122. Before parting with, this Court deems it necessary
to directly remind the petitioners that the punishment modified by
this Court should not be mistaken as indulgence or leniency. The
petitioners must recognize that being student of medicine
carries with it even higher responsibility; for, the profession is
intrinsically linked with compassion, integrity, and service to
humanity. It is, therefore, expected that the petitioners will treat
this opportunity as a turning point, reform their ways, and dedicate
themselves to becoming not only competent medical professionals
but also conscientious citizens. The onus, now, lies heavily upon
the petitioners to demonstrate, through conduct and diligence, that
the trust reposed by this Court upon them is not misplaced and in
Patna High Court CWJC No.19657 of 2024 dt.19-09-2025
51/51
future, they shall uphold the dignity of their institution, serve
society at large and embody the ethical values that the medical
profession demands.
123. With the aforesaid observation, direction and
modification, these writ applications are disposed, with costs.
124. The petitioners shall pay the cost of litigation of Rs.
25,000/- each to the University within a period of three months
from today.
